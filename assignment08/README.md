# Massachussetts Early Education and Care: Increasing Accessbility of Early Education and Child Care Information for Parents
## Karlina Ho

### Introduction
This DH 150 project seeks to analyze and improve upon a multitude of design and accessibility features on the Massachusetts Early Education and Care site. A leading predictor regarding academic success and achievement among students revolves around the degree to which parents are involved in their child's education. Yet, numerous digital platforms and webpages often showcase inaccessible content for marginalized groups of parents including non-English speakers, disabled persons, and individuals with age-related impairments/disabilities. With the goal of educational sites to allow educators and government officials the ability to connect with parents and relay crucial information regarding their child's education, website accessibility remains essential for educational equity. As a result, the goal of this project is to enable individuals the opportunity to access the needed information regrding early education and child care programs in an efficient manner by analyzing and understanding how the design of the Massachusetts Early Education and Care site assists or prevents usability for site vistors through a variety of evalutional methods consisting of contextual inquiry, UX storytelling, UX prototyping, and task-based testing. This project will ultimately serve parents, guardians, and other parental figures found in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to locate the needed infromation found on the EEC site ranging from financial aid assistance to child care program locations in an accessible and intuitive manner.  

### Design Statement
This UX design project aims to impact and assist in the live of parents, guardians, and other child caregivers by presenting improved features when locating information on the Massachusetts Early Education and Care site. Through multiple rounds of evaluation and user testing, I was able to conclude the the site failed to remain accessible in two areas including lack of acessibility and ease of readability, as the site itself held lots of information with pages that were full of lengthy information that required users to sift through, plus lack of efficency and personability, as the site prevented users to locate specific information to enroll their child in child care programs in an expedited and personalized manner that tailors searches to their current situations.  

### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
To better understand how education-related sites in Massachusetts were presenting information to its users, I conducted a heuristic evaluation on two sites including The Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care (EEC), which sets the politics and regulations affiliated to early education and care services and programs and provides various resources, programs, certifications, and news made to assist caregivers with childhood development. the other site analyzed was the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (ESE), which promotes the accessibility of early childhood resources, materials, and services accross Massachusetts for all public schools ranging from pre-k to high school. Both of these sites were analyzed, as they presented similar information in comparable formats, and related to my chosen design subjects including education and children. Consequently, this assignment delves deeper into the government-affiliated sites of the Early and Elementary plus Secondary education sites of Massachusetts and analyzes their accessibility and usability through a heuristic  evaluation [Read more by Karlina Ho](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment01README.md)
