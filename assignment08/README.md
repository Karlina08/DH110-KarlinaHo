# Massachussetts Early Education and Care: Increasing Accessbility of Early Education and Child Care Information for Parents
## Karlina Ho

### Introduction
This DH 150 project seeks to analyze and improve upon a multitude of design and accessibility features on the Massachusetts Early Education and Care site. A leading predictor regarding academic success and achievement among students revolves around the degree to which parents are involved in their child's education. Yet, numerous digital platforms and webpages often showcase inaccessible content for marginalized groups of parents including non-English speakers, disabled persons, and individuals with age-related impairments/disabilities. With the goal of educational sites to allow educators and government officials the ability to connect with parents and relay crucial information regarding their child's education, website accessibility remains essential for educational equity. As a result, the goal of this project is to enable individuals the opportunity to access the needed information regrding early education and child care programs in an efficient manner by analyzing and understanding how the design of the Massachusetts Early Education and Care site assists or prevents usability for site vistors through a variety of evalutional methods consisting of contextual inquiry, UX storytelling, UX prototyping, and task-based testing. This project will ultimately serve parents, guardians, and other parental figures found in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to locate the needed infromation found on the EEC site ranging from financial aid assistance to child care program locations in an accessible and intuitive manner.  

### Design Statement
This UX design project aims to impact and assist in the live of parents, guardians, and other child caregivers by presenting improved features when locating information on the Massachusetts Early Education and Care site. Through multiple rounds of evaluation and user testing, I was able to conclude the the site failed to remain accessible in two areas including lack of acessibility and ease of readability, as the site itself held lots of information with pages that were full of lengthy information that required users to sift through, plus lack of efficency and personability, as the site prevented users to locate specific information to enroll their child in child care programs in an expedited and personalized manner that tailors searches to their current situations.  

### Competitor Analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
To better understand how education-related sites in Massachusetts were presenting information to its users, I conducted a heuristic evaluation on two sites including The Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care (EEC), which sets the politics and regulations affiliated to early education and care services and programs and provides various resources, programs, certifications, and news made to assist caregivers with childhood development. the other site analyzed was the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (ESE), which promotes the accessibility of early childhood resources, materials, and services accross Massachusetts for all public schools ranging from pre-k to high school. Both of these sites were analyzed, as they presented similar information in comparable formats, and related to my chosen design subjects including education and children. Consequently, this assignment delves deeper into the government-affiliated sites of the Early and Elementary plus Secondary education sites of Massachusetts and analyzes their accessibility and usability through a heuristic  evaluation [Read more by Karlina Ho](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment01README.md).

### User Research
Usability testing was conducted on the Massachusetts Early Education and Care site to locate site improvements from the user's perspective and surrounded itself through a user's ability to gain access to financial assistance towards early education and care programs for their families with the goal of enabling underrepresented and lower socioeconomic communities the opportunity to acquire support for the growth and development of children and obtain assistance in the pursuit of the child's educational endeavors. To test this, user's were asked to perform routine tasks related to the process of obtaining financial assistance for early education and care programs. Namely, my participant believed that an abundant amount of links were present, resulting in possible confusion for older individuals and mass amounts of scrolling resulted in search difficulties, exemplifying the lack of recognition and recall plus aesthetic and minimalist design [Read more by Karlina Ho](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment03README.md). 

### UX Storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
The purpose of UX Storytelling is to enable researchers and designers the opportunity to understand how a site or product provides value to the user and satisfies their needs and gain firsthand insight about their users' motivations, feelings, and needs and reflect on what certain areas of the design process must be altered to better fit a user's goal. As a result, two personas to explore two design features including filters for expedited and more personalized and filtered information search and results and auto-complete search bar for user recognition rather than recall were developed. Persona #1 included Bethany, the teen mom who hoped to obtain childcare financial assitance for her newborn and feels confusion on where to find the exact information she needs on the site. Persona #2 centered around John, the recent divorcee who sough to learn if him and his children were eligible for financial assistance as a result of his lost job but feels overwhelmed due to the amount of information on the site [Read more by Karlina Ho](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment04README.md).

### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation 
Low-fidelity prototyping provides individuals with a quick and easy opportunity to transform high-level design prototypes and concepts into physical and demonstrable products to ultimately gain user feedback and implement needed changes throughout the design cycle while addressing and resolving problems for users at an early stage. The creation of a low-fidelity prototype enables designers to make necessary changes needed for users through the feedback of others before creating a high-fidelity prototype as well. The tasks and features of the low-fi protoype in this assignment stem from user research such as usability testing of current MA Deapartment of Early Education and Care (EEC) site features to inquire about financial assistance for early education and care programs in Massachusetts, contextual inquiry of potential target users, and additional overservations based on my own personal experiences with the EEC site. With this in mind, the two tasks/features that the system will need to support include narrowing child care program options with additional/advanced filters and utilizing auto-complete search bar to predict user's searches on EEC site.

### Low-Fidelity Prototype
Utilizing my low-fidelity prototype, I was able to digitize these wireframes through Figma to ultimately construct a high-level design of my chosen website— the Massachusett's Early Education and Care site. Throughout this design, I hope to aid parents and guardians in Massachusetts to gain better access to information surrounding financial aid in regards to early education programs for their children, An impression test with a user in regards to shape, typography, and color variations was also conducted to better understand what components were most favorable and accessible for the user and their overall experience with the site [Read more by Karlina Ho](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment06README.md).

###  High-Fidelity Prototype 
This interactive program was designed to address the culmination of issues garnered that prevented individuals located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to access resources, financial assistance aid, and suggesstions for early education and child care programs in a efficient and timely manner. The Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) site allows users to inquire about a plethora of advice and information related to child care programs, certifications, news and additional resources made to aid parents, guardians, and caregivers with childhood development. As a result, I redesigned certain aspects of the Massachuseets Department of Early Education and Care site to incorporate features suggested from prior UX Storytelling and user personas such as filters and auto-filled suggestions for the main search bar. This high fidelity prototype gives users a life-like and visual aid in seeing and evalutating the suggested tasks and features becoming implemented into the site, while validating the user's interaction flows and suggesting potential influences in regards to the choices users make when they navigate the site [Read more by Karlina Ho](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment07README.md).

### Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?
Overall, the UX design process was challenging, yet extremely rewarding, and allowed me to learn a tremendous amount of infromation related to UX. Coming from a background with no UI/UX knowledge, I was immersed and experienced firsthand the steps of conducting UX research, performing usabiilty testing, and learning how to use numerous tools to construct wireframes and wireflows for prototypes through Figma. My main takeaways from this project include: 

Design Skills: From hand-sketching wireframes to digitizing each site and its flows through Figma, I was able to utilize the various skills and methods learned in class from Figma and apply them when re-creating my site as my wireframes depicted a site with various compenents including text, color, and GUI components. Even more, I was able to gain familirity with additional design tools such as Adobe XD and Framer. Through my career and interest in entrepreneruship and social media content creation and mockups, I hope to continue to build upon these skills learned and apply them to my future career. 

The Importance of User Testing and Feedback: Through my multiple rounds of feedback and testing from my initial site evaluation to my high-fidelity prototype, I learned how important gaining insight and feeback from others were. Oftentimes, my subjects would point out a component or area of my site that I had orginally not seen or considered for revision. By fully understanding the user's experiences, I am able to alleviate the bias of the desifginer (myself), and implement changes and constructive design changes in a way that benefit the user. 

Graphical Interface Accessibility: Prior to this project, I was unaware of the standards for accessibilty, including the plugin Stark and the WCAG2.0 AA and AAA standards. I found it extremely interesting to learn that the contrast ratio for items must be at least least 7:1 for normal text and around 3:1 for large text, and taught me the importance of making the correct graphical interface choices in order for the site to be clear and accessible for users.
