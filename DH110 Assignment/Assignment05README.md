> # Low Fidelity Prototype
> ### _Karlina Ho || DGT HUM 150 || Assignment 05: UX Wireframe/Paper Protoype_

## ðŸ“± *Overview* 
### *Purpose* 
* Low-fidelity prototyping provides individuals with a quick and easy opportunity to transform high-level design prototypes and concepts into physical and demonstrable products to ultimately gain user feedback and implement needed changes throughout the design cycle. Additionally with this feedback, designers are able to address and resolve problems for users at an early stage.  
* By creating a low-fidelity prototype and testing the prototype with another individual, I am able to make the necessary changes needed for users through the feedback of others before creating a high-fidelity prototype. 

### *User Research* 
* Based on my [user research](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment03README.mdhttps://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment03README.md) (contextual inquiry), this assignment will focus itself around three research questions including:
