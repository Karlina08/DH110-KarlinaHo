> # Low Fidelity Prototype
> ### _Karlina Ho || DGT HUM 150 || Assignment 05: UX Wireframe/Paper Protoype_

## ðŸ“± *Overview* 
### *Purpose* 
* Low-fidelity prototyping provides individuals with a quick and easy opportunity to transform high-level design prototypes and concepts into physical and demonstrable products to ultimately gain user feedback and implement needed changes throughout the design cycle. Additionally with this feedback, designers are able to address and resolve problems for users at an early stage.  
* By creating a low-fidelity prototype and testing the prototype with another individual, I am able to make the necessary changes needed for users through the feedback of others before creating a high-fidelity prototype. 

### *User Research* 
* Based on my [user research](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment03README.md) (contextual inquiry), this assignment will focus itself around three research questions including: 
  * How might we improve the Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care Site to provide users with information related to child care and early education programs?
  * How might the site become more efficient for users to search for financial assistance related to child care and early education programs?
  * How might users find contact information for child care and early education programs in a more streamlined manner? 

### *Personas and Scenarios*
* Using these research questions, [UX Storytelling](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment04README.md) through personas and empathy maps were utilized to gain firsthand insight on the motivations, goals, and feelings of potential users regarding the suggested design features to achieve goals in a more efficent manner. Two personas were created to address the above research questions such as: 
  * A teen mother who needed to locate child care programs for her newborn to go back to school in a timely manner.
  * A recent male divorcee who wanted to learn if he was eligible for financial child care financial assistance as a result of his lost job. 

### *Tasks/Features*
* The tasks and features of the low-fi protoype in this assignment stem from user research such as usability testing of current MA Deapartment of Early Education and Care (EEC) site features to inquire about financial assistance for early education and care programs in Massachusetts. contextual inquiry of potential target users, and additional overservations based on my own personal experiences with the EEC site. With this in mind, the two tasks/features that the system will need to support includes: 
  * Narrowing child care program options with additional/advanced filters 
  * Including auto-complete search bar to predict user's searches on EEC site
