## ðŸ–¥  *Introduction*
### *Overview* 
* [Figma Desktop Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/3wHCEjjMASZpQi2iAoOjTY/Untitled)
* [Desktop Prototype Wireflow]()
* [User Testing Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uqp9t4XKISasU6BcmDBQgQf2BzXSUMIH/view?usp=sharing)

### *Description* 
* Utilizing my low-fidelity prototype found in [Assignment 5](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment05README.md), I was able to digitize these wireframes to ultimately construct a high-level design of my chosen websiteâ€” the Massachusett's Early Education and Care site. Throughout this design, I hope to aid parents and guardians in Massachusetts to gain better access to information surrounding financial aid in regards to early education programs for their children. 
### *Process* 
* Throughout this specific assignment, I was given the opportunity to utilize Figma to continue to improve upon my skills regarding inserting text, drawing shapes, and producing GUI components. Additionally, an impression test with a user in regards to shape, typography, and color variations was be conducted to better understand what components were most favorable and accessible for the user and their overall experience with the site. This test is also used to describe why each design element was chosen. to construct these wireframes, I utilized my low-fidelity prototypes linked above.   
### *Purpose* 
* Overall, the purpose of this testing is to delve deeper into the embedded features suggested from [UX Storytelling and user personas](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment05README.md). More specifically, this specific design correlates with persona, "Bethany." Filters were implemented into Bethany's site experience to locate child care programs efficiently and swiftly. This prototupe utilizes improved UI material components and features taken from the low-fidelity prototype. Even more, an important purpose of these activity is to test various variations and site elements to best understand what fonts, colors, and shapes must be used for a positive user experience. Note, this activity focused heavily and the includion of filters when searching for child care programs in Massachusetts. Therefore, the frame chosen for variations was the child care program search frame. A finalized design wireframe can be found below:

Because I was designing a desktop webpage, I adhered to an 8x8 grid for for ease when creating UI components together neatly, visibly, and consistently.

To conduct the impression test of my design variations, I interviewed my user over Zoom. To execute the test, users were briefly given an explantation about the test. For the test, I showed the user one screen at a time for about 10 seconds each. Then, the user was asked to provide feedback on the design variations for the designer/researcher to gain a better understanding of the design strengths and weaknesses. The test was executed in the order below: 

* **Shape** 
  * When asked to provide feedback about the shapes, the user expressed favorability towards the first shape (rectangular/sharp edges). "Espically for a desktop website, I feel that it looks cleaner and easier to use," the participant stated. Even more, the user also discussed how the rectangular shape allows users to better utilize the drop down feastures found on the site, as it provided clarity and acknowledgement to the dropdown feature instead of obscuring it and having users mistaking it for a button. Overall, the rectangular shape made the webpage look cohesive and fit the professional aesthetic of a government website. 

* **Font**
  * When describing the font variations found on the site, the user believed that the first font used (Noto Sans) was the best option for the site, as the other font options seemingly lacked professionalism on the government-affiliated site. Even more, the more decorative and playful font options such as the Wendy One font became difficult for the user to read as the font size became smaller and were overall not a good fit for the site. 

* **Color** 
  * Although the user liked both colors when discussing the light and dark mode options, the user leaned more towards the light mode alternative due to personal preference in conjunction with contrast (white and light gray had less of a stark constrast). Specifically for this variation, color may have to continue to be tested in the future to additional confounding variables other than user preference will affect user accessbility in regards to site color. 

## ðŸ–¥  *Results*
Based on the feedback gathered from the usability test, I will utilize the Noto Sans font with rectangular shapes while utilizing the color scheme found in the light mode variation.

According to WCAG2.0 AA and AAA standards, the contrast ratio for items must be at least least 7:1 for normal text and around 3:1 for large text. A
