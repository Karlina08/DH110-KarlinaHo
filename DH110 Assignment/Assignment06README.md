## ðŸ–¥  *Introduction*
### *Overview* 
* [Figma Desktop Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/3wHCEjjMASZpQi2iAoOjTY/Untitled)
* [Desktop Prototype Wireflow](https://www.figma.com/file/3wHCEjjMASZpQi2iAoOjTY/Untitled)
### *Description* 
* Utilizing my low-fidelity prototype found in [Assignment 5](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment05README.md), I was able to digitize these wireframes to ultimately construct a high-level design of my chosen websiteâ€” the Massachusett's Early Education and Care site. Throughout this design, I hope to aid parents and guardians in Massachusetts to gain better access to information surrounding financial aid in regards to early education programs for their children. 
### *Process* 
* Throughout this specific assignment, I was given the opportunity to utilize Figma to continue to improve upon my skills regarding inserting text, drawing shapes, and producing GUI components. Additionally, an impression test with a user in regards to shape, typography, and color variations was be conducted to better understand what components were most favorable and accessible for the user and their overall experience with the site. This test is also used to describe why each design element was chosen. to construct these wireframes, I utilized my low-fidelity prototypes linked above.   
### *Purpose* 
* Overall, the purpose of this testing is to delve deeper into the embedded features suggested from [UX Storytelling and and user personas](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment05README.md). More specifically, this specific design correlates with persona, "Bethany." Filters were implemented into Bethany's site experience to locate child care programs efficiently and swiftly. This prototupe utilizes improved UI material components and features taken from the low-fidelity prototype. Even more, an important purpose of these activity is to test various variations and site elements to best understand what fonts, colors, and shapes must be used for a positive user experience. Note, this activity focused heavily and the includion of filters when searching for child care programs in Massachusetts. Therefore, the frame chosen for variations was the child care program search frame. A finalized design wireframe can be found below:
