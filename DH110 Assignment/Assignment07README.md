> # High Fidelity Prototype
> ### _Karlina Ho || DGT HUM 150 || Assignment 07: UX Interactive Prototype_

## ðŸ–¥  *Introduction*
### *Description*
* This interactive program was designed to address the culmination of issues garnered that prevented individuals located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to access resources, financial assistance aid, and suggesstions for early education and child care programs in a efficient and timely manner. The [Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-early-education-and-care) (EEC) site allows users to inquire about a plethora of advice and information related to child care programs, certifications, news and additional resources made to aid parents, guardians, and caregivers with childhood development. As a result, I redesigned certain aspects of the Massachuseets Department of Early Education and Care site to incorporate features suggested from prior UX Storytelling and user personas such as filters and auto-filled suggestions for the main search bar. 

### *Purpose*
* The purpose of this high fidelity prototype is to give users a life-like and visual aid in seeing and evalutating the suggested tasks and features becoming implemented into the site. Even more, this prototype validates and supports user's interaction flows and suggests potential influences in regards to the choices users make when navigate the site. 

### *Process*
* For this interactive prototype, I utilized Figma to design, revise, and create my high fidelity prototype. Specifically for the revisions, I implemented feedback from Professor Sookie, my DH 110 classmates, and numerous individuals at UCLA. With these walkthroughs and suggestions, I was given the opportunity to continuously improve upon my previous designs to ensure that users of the EEC site were able to information throughout the site such as child care programs in a timely, efficient, and intuitive manner. 


## ðŸ–¥  *Tasks*
* The tasks found in the high fidelity prototype center around two previously proposed designed features for previous [UX Storytelling and user personas](https://github.com/KarlinaHo/DH110-KarlinaHo/blob/main/DH110%20Assignment/Assignment05README.md), along with using additional features of the site: 
    * ***Navigating the EEC homepage's search bar to locate a guide and search for licensed school age programs***: To do this, the user must find the search button, click on it, and type in their desired searches. Query auto-complete options will predict the user's searches based on the characters they enter, which ultimately allow users to efficiently locate the information they are looking for on a site and narrow down their specific searches. 
    * ***Utilizing the implemented filters for early education programs to find a licensed child care program***: Users will use these newly added filters to find specific licensed child care programs by selecting and typing in a variety of requests to gather search results for licensed child care programs. Users are given the ability to either directly click on the hyperlinked name of the suggested child care program or utilize the map. Then, individuals will access the program details of a child care program that best matched their requests.

## ðŸ–¥  *Cognitive Walkthrough*
* [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GulwEqksHzR866cVXCuQk395fohC-jiQ/view?usp=sharing) to the cognitive walkthrough with Christina Cha. Special thanks to Jason Lai and Amanda Johnson for providing feedback through our in-class cognitive walkthrough as well. 
## *Summary and Reflection*
* Overall, the cognitive walkthroughs went smoothly. Although during the in-class cognitive walkthroughs had some small technical difficulties with the "screen-sharing" feature not working on my end, I was able to send the link to my classmates for them to share which was different from what I had initially expected (such as not being able to navigate to certain screens). Although having someone fully assist me with the walkthrough could have led to bias, the feedback I recieved was extremely helpful. This did not happen through my other walkthrough, and because of my in-class walkthroughs, I was able to prepare for any potential technial difficulties by asking the participant if "she could see my screen." 
* For my in-class walkthroughs with Jason and Amanda, the feedback I got related to little confusion for users to navigate the site along with great understanding of the logical progression for finding the child care programs, however a main concern Jason discussed during was how users may not recognize where to click or select when there were underlined links without the text explicitly stating "click here," which I did not initially realize, as the underlined text was not related to the assigned tasks. Additionally, Jason and Amanda had pointed out that he had wished he was able to see additional screens, which was contributed to my inability to share the screen myself due to another technical glitch and lack of screens, which I heavily ensured would not happen again by altering the interactive wireflows. Amanda also pointed out that users would have an issue not knowing what to do during the next step in regards to the "Find a licensed Family, Group, or School Age Child Care program" guide as the boxes for alerts and the "find child care programs" link were extremely similar in size. I found this insight to be extremely fascinating, as Christina stated the same thing during her cognitive walkthrough and suggested that the sizes of the alert and key actions should be altered to ensure users would be able to understand what to do for the next step. Besides this, Christina believed that the site and its interaction flow were very intuitive and straightforward with the webpage possessing clear buttons and site indicators.

## ðŸ–¥  *Previous Prototypes & Feedback*
* Based on the feedback I recieved from my walkthroughs, I implemented two changes that are found in the picture below. 
     
     * First, to eradicate any confusion regarding confusing hyperlinks that the user might miss with no direct call to action, I simply removed them and replaced them with textual directions explaining how to get to their desired information such as, "find licensed child care programs below."
     
     * Second, to implement the suggestions related to users having issues about not knowing what to do during the next step when finding licensed Family, Group, or School Age Child Care programs guide, I changed the text and shape sizes of the yellow alert box and licensed child care program search box. To further implement the first feedback, I also changed the statements to have more direct and clear directions for users by stating, "Search for a licensed child care program here.

 * Third, to ensure that the interactive and automated wireflow was presented correctly and additional screens were seen, I inserted additional frames into the prototype. I began my low-fidelity prototype with 6-7 screens. Now, I have 19 wireframes with flows that allow users to return back to the home page.
