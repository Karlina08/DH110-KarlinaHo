> ### _Karlina Ho || DGT HUM 150 || Assignment 07: UX Interactive Prototype_

## ðŸ–¥  *Introduction*
### *Description*
* This interactive program was designed to address the culmination of issues garnered that prevented individuals located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to access financial assistance for early education and child care programs in a efficient and timely manner. The [Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-early-education-and-care) (EEC) site allows users to inquire about a plethora of advice and information related to child care programs, certifications, news and additional resources made to aid parents, guardians, and caregivers with childhood development. As a result, I redesigned certain aspects of the Massachuseets Department of Early Education and Care site to incorporate features suggested from prior UX Storytelling and user personas such as filters and auto-filled suggestions for the main search bar.
