## Karlina Ho || DGT HUM 150 || Assignment 02: Usability Evaluation with Users

### Introduction

The [Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-early-education-and-care) (EEC) is part of the Executive Office of Education. In addition, the Department is the chief agency concerning the entirety of early education and care services found in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The main responsibiity of the EEC is to create and implement the politics and regulations associated with early education and care services and programs. The site also provides users with numerous resources, programs, certifications, and news designed to aid parents, guardians, and caregivers alike with childhood development.

After performing a heuristic evaluation on the site, a multitude of usability issues were found. The three most apparent issues throughout the site include:

- 1. **Error Prevention:** As the EEC is associated with the main Massachusetts Government website, users on the site are given the option to click on a menu button on the top left corner of the page to explore other pages affiliated with the MA government. Consequently, it was vague whether or not the user was still located on the EEC page. Error-prone conditions are not eliminated as no confirmation option is available to users before commiting and executing the action to explore another page. 

- 2. **Recognition Rather Than Recall:** The search bar on the site failed to provide users with autocompletion/potential search bar results (recognition feature), consequently preventing them from reducing their memory load and forcing them to engage in recall.  

- 3. **Aesthetic and Minimialist Design:** Large amounts of text with lack of headings, bolded words, hyperlinks, etc. contributed to the site's lack of aesthetic and minimalist designs throughout many pages of the site. This ultimately resulted in the lessening of the visibility of important information.  

As a result of these issues, a usability test will be ran to ultimately evaluate how the EEC site either strengthens or weakens a user's ability to perform specific tasks. A usability test is used to assist in the improvement of the usability of a product by analyzing how practical and sufficient the design is (informing design), preliminary examination prior to reveal (eliminating frustration), and lessening the cost of support and service for greater user satisfaction (improving profitability). Overall, the test assesses the product's effectiveness, efficiency, and satsifaction. 

In **Task 1,** participant users will be asked to search for a specific early education and care program to gauge the effetiveness of the site's organizations and hyperlinks are for finding needed information. This task nay also exemplify lack of error prevention on the website, which results in user experience difficulty. 
During **Task 2,** users will search for financial assistance ragarding child care and check if they are eligible for funding. Depending on the length it takes the user to complete the task, this may provide insight into the site's effectiveness in regards to organization. Lastly, in **Task 3,** users will locate a guide on the side and locate a link for additional questions. From the survery, I hope to discover the user's satisfaction extent with their completion of each task along with their comfortability of using the site. Throughout the Usability Test, I will explore and improve upon the site's degree of usability from the perspective and viewpoint of the user itself. 

### Methodology 
This usability test was conducted via Zoom where both particpants were located in a quiet room in their apartment. A Macbook pro was used to record the session, and Zoom was utilized as the recording and video platform. Users were located in different rooms, but tuned into the Zoom synchronously. In person however, the user and the interviewer would sit either adjacent or across from each other during the duration of the test. Before beginning the usability test. Before beginning the survey, the participant will be presented with an informed consent page to ensure communication. Throughout the study, the user will think aloud and walk the researcher through their proceses and discuss the results and views on the success of their completed task. Upon completing the tasks, the user will then share their perspective on their ease and time of completing the task, along with a variety of topics including degree of satisfaction, the complexity and ease of the site's navigation, and ideas for improvement. Finally, the participan will fill out a confidential questionarrie about their demogprahics including their age and ethnicity.

Note: This usability test is a **pilot test**.

### Reflection 
Throughout the usability test, I noticed that I tended to assist the user when tasks took longer than the seemingly normal period of time. Although the first and second task was completed fairly quickly by the user, I found it interesting the difficulty of the third task was for the user, and did not expect the user to believe that they had successfully completed the task the first time when they actually hadn't, promting assistance from myself to the user. 
In the future, I hope to improve on readiness, and intend to test out the script beforehand. I noticed several typos made throughout my Usability Test when conducting the pilot test, and would ensure in the feature that grammatical errors were eradicated. 
Overall, conducting this test allowed me to gain valuable knowledge and insight into the percieved wesbite accessibility of others and allowed me to further analyze what it means to have a site that is "accessible for all." Things I originally thought were seemingly common protocols such as using the search bar to search for items wre replaced with the actual usage of click through links, enabling me to better understand the importance of topics such as error prevention. 

From this pilot, I learned that the wording of the questionaire greatly impacts the way the user answers the question and that unclear wording can lead to answer discrepancy. When asked, "how likely wuld you do this task," the user was unsure to answer the question based on the perspective of a parent using the website or actually himself. Furthermore, I learned that the user believed that the website failed to be successful in the realm of organization, as task 3 took the user more time than expected to complete. He felt that the final task was complex to execute, and went to the wrong page numerous times to look for information regarding the Help Desk. Additionally, the user believed that a lot of unused space on he website, alluding to the idea of lack of aesthetic and minimalistic design.   

I noticed that the user's inability to complete task 3 revealed that the embeding of a multitude of links to find certain information can prevent indiviuals from finding specific information on the site and the links needed to find the guides were not intuitive. Even more, because the site is found within the main MA government website, it was unclear among individuals whether or not they had even left the early education and care site. 

In conclusion, I learned a lot about the thoughts and feelings of a user interacting with the EEC site, and found it extremely interesting the unique paths each user takes in order to complete the tasks. I believe that overall, the testing went well as I was able to solidify the idea that the site was somewhat problematic with users being unable to effieciently complete tasks and find information in a timely manner. I noticed that I would also have to encourage conversation from the user and remind them to speak aloud. As mentioned before, I must be more congnizant of how much information/help I provide to the user and be prepared for unexpected questions dealing with the wording of the questions. Although I was surprised to see how the user interacted with the site through the use of a multitude of tabs, it was insightful to see athe user's perspective to ultimately uncover the improvement of the website's accessibility.
