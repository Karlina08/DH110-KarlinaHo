# Pilot Usability Test

## Karlina Ho || DGT HUM 150 || Assignment 02: Usability Evaluation with Users

### Introduction

The [Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-early-education-and-care) (EEC) is part of the Executive Office of Education. In addition, the Department is the chief agency concerning the entirety of early education and care services found in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The main responsibiity of the EEC is to create and implement the politics and regulations associated with early education and care services and programs. The site also provides users with numerous resources, programs, certifications, and news designed to aid parents, guardians, and caregivers alike with childhood development.

After performing a heuristic evaluation on the site, a multitude of usability issues were found. The three most apparent issues throughout the site include:

- 1. **Error Prevention:** As the EEC is associated with the main Massachusetts Government website, users on the site are given the option to click on a menu button on the top left corner of the page to explore other pages affiliated with the MA government. Consequently, it was vague whether or not the user was still located on the EEC page. Error-prone conditions are not eliminated as no confirmation option is available to users before commiting and executing the action to explore another page. 

- 2. **Recognition Rather Than Recall:** The search bar on the site failed to provide users with autocompletion/potential search bar results (recognition feature), consequently preventing them from reducing their memory load and forcing them to engage in recall.  

- 3. **Aesthetic and Minimialist Design:** Large amounts of text with lack of headings, bolded words, hyperlinks, etc. contributed to the site's lack of aesthetic and minimalist designs throughout many pages of the site. This ultimately resulted in the lessening of the visibility of important information.  

As a result of these issues, a usability test will be ran to ultimately evaluate how the EEC site either strengthens or weakens a user's ability to perform specific tasks. A usability test is defined as..... . This test determines ....  


A usability test is utilized to examine the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the product. In Task 1, I will ask the user to perform a search for Economics Requirements to determine how effective the search function is for retrieving results. This task will also demonstrate the extent to which the lack of error prevention creates a difficult experience for the user. It will further enlighten me as to what aspects of the search function can be improved. In Task 2, the user will locate career resources and pathways for an economics major. This will assess the efficiency of locating these pages. I can observe how the cluttered website affects the time it takes for a user to complete this task. In Task 3, the user is asked to find the counseling department in order to book an appointment with a counselor. Through the survey, I will be able to determine the degree to which the user is satisfied with the task and how comfortable the user is with utilizing the website. The goal is to understand and improve the website's usability from the user's perspective.
