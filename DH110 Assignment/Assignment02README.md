## Karlina Ho || DGT HUM 150 || Assignment 02: Usability Evaluation with Users

### Introduction

The [Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-early-education-and-care) (EEC) is part of the Executive Office of Education. In addition, the Department is the chief agency concerning the entirety of early education and care services found in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The main responsibiity of the EEC is to create and implement the politics and regulations associated with early education and care services and programs. The site also provides users with numerous resources, programs, certifications, and news designed to aid parents, guardians, and caregivers alike with childhood development.

After performing a heuristic evaluation on the site, a multitude of usability issues were found. The three most apparent issues throughout the site include:

- 1. **Error Prevention:** As the EEC is associated with the main Massachusetts Government website, users on the site are given the option to click on a menu button on the top left corner of the page to explore other pages affiliated with the MA government. Consequently, it was vague whether or not the user was still located on the EEC page. Error-prone conditions are not eliminated as no confirmation option is available to users before commiting and executing the action to explore another page. 

- 2. **Recognition Rather Than Recall:** The search bar on the site failed to provide users with autocompletion/potential search bar results (recognition feature), consequently preventing them from reducing their memory load and forcing them to engage in recall.  

- 3. **Aesthetic and Minimialist Design:** Large amounts of text with lack of headings, bolded words, hyperlinks, etc. contributed to the site's lack of aesthetic and minimalist designs throughout many pages of the site. This ultimately resulted in the lessening of the visibility of important information.  

As a result of these issues, a usability test will be ran to ultimately evaluate how the EEC site either strengthens or weakens a user's ability to perform specific tasks. A usability test is used to assist in the improvement of the usability of a product by analyzing how practical and sufficient the design is (informing design), preliminary examination prior to reveal (eliminating frustration), and lessening the cost of support and service for greater user satisfaction (improving profitability). Overall, the test assesses the product's effectiveness, efficiency, and satsifaction. 

In **Task 1,** participant users will be asked to search for a specific early education and care program to gauge the effetiveness of the site's organizations and hyperlinks are for finding needed information. This task nay also exemplify lack of error prevention on the website, which results in user experience difficulty. 
During **Task 2,** users will search for financial assistance ragarding child care and check if they are eligible for funding. Depending on the length it takes the user to complete the task, this may provide insight into the site's effectiveness in regards to organization. Lastly, in **Task 3,** users will locate a guide on the side and locate a link for additional questions. From the survery, I hope to discover the user's satisfaction extent with their completion of each task along with their comfortability of using the site. Throughout the Usability Test, I will explore and improve upon the site's degree of usability from the perspective and viewpoint of the user itself. 

### Methodology 
#### This usability test was conducted via Zoom where both particpants were located in a quiet room in their apartment. A Macbook pro was used to record the session, and Zoom was utilized as the recording and video platform. Users were located in different rooms, but tuned into the Zoom synchronously. In person however, the user and the interviewer would sit either adjacent or across from each other during the duration of the test. Before beginning the usability test. Before beginning the survey, the participant will be presented with an informed consent page to ensure communication. Throughout the study, the user will think aloud and walk the researcher through their proceses and discuss the results and views on the success of their completed task. Upon completing the tasks, the user will then share their perspective on their ease and time of completing the task, along with a variety of topics including degree of satisfaction, the complexity and ease of the site's navigation, and  ideas for improvement. 
 The user will provide detailed feedback about their thought process and evaluate the extent to which task completion was successful. The user will also assess other elements such as how quickly tasks are completed, the degree of satisfaction and comfort the user feels toward the website, and potential suggestions for improvement. The user will complete a section on demographic data which will be kept confidential.

This usability test is intended as a pilot test.
