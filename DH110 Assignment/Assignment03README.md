## *Introductory Steps* 
## ✏️ Step 01: Specify the Main Challenge 
**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
* The main activity this project would support for the users will surround itself around their ability to gain access to financial assistance towards early education and care programs for their families. Consequently, this will hopefully enable underrepresented and lower socioeconomic communities the opportunity to acquire support for the growth and development of children and obtain assistance in the pursuit of the child's educational endeavors.    

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
* The basic need/goal involved in this activity is education and financial accessibility. Allowing access to education by gaining financial assistance for the user's families gives their children the opportunity to prepare for their future by cultivating new perspectives, exploring and building upon current knowledge for the purpose of informing others, and gaining access to a wider range of professional career and personal growth opportunities. 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
* Currently, to satisfy the financial assistance needs for early education and care programs, families are able to contact Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies (CCR&Rs) or enroll in Child Care Payment Programs, cash aid/welfare assistance programs, and other subsidized child care programs. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology**
* Present limitations regarding financial assistance for early education and care programs include the inability to access the information in an efficient manner online, and obtaining the correct individuals to inquire about financial assistance often becomes cumbersome through the need to speak with multipl individuals through a prolonged period of time. To better facilitate the journey of acquiring financial assistance of early education and care programs, users should be given a digital guide with access to direct contacts for a more streamlined process, rather than being provided external links that require users to perform additional research for contact information.  

## ✏️ Step 02: Identify Target Users
**What are the characteristics of users?** 
* **Demographics** 
    * Indivuals (parent(s), guardian, grandparent(s), etc.) who have or are taking care of children that are currently within the ages of birth to 12 years old and currently reside in the state of Massachusetts. Additionally, these users usually possess household incomes that are at or below 50% of the state median income and are low socioeconomic status households.   
* **Preferences** 
    * These users currently demonstrate financial need and/or hardship within their families, therefore needed guidance and help in obtaining financial assistance for early educatiion and care programs for their children. 
* **Expertise** 
    * Users do not need any specific level of expertise to be able to navigate through this site. 

**In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?** 
* In order for users to inquire about financial assistance for early education and care programs in Massachusetts, users must visit the [Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-early-education-and-care) (EEC) site to find information. Users would most likely visit this site from their own households. Consequently, accessibility remains a crucial component for the site in order to ensure that users can gain access to the needed information to begin the process of obtaining financial assistance for early education and care programs. Once the user finds the information on the site, users may then the call, "Mass 211" or can visit or contact their local Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) agency. The phone call may take place virtually anywhere, and their agencies may vary from city to city in the state of Massachusetts. 

**What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity?** 
* To gain access to financial assistance for these childhood education and care programs, users visit the [Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-early-education-and-care) (EEC) site and click on the "Early education and care financial assistance for families" link under the "I want to..." tab. Then, they would look through the eligibility requirements. If they meet these criteria, they can move onto the "how to apply section of the site and either call "Mass 211" or contact and/or visit their closest Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) agency. If funding is available, users will be sent a notice via mail that asks them to schedule an appointment with their local Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) agency. If funding is not available, their name will be placed on a wailist. During this time, users may be sent a confirmation and renewal letter via mail. 

## ✏️ Step 03: Pick Qualitative Research Method(s)
