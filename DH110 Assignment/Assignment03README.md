## *Introductory Steps* 
## ✏️ Step 01: Specify the Main Challenge 
**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
* The main activity this project would support for the users will surround itself around their ability to gain access to financial assistance towards early education and care programs for their families. Consequently, this will hopefully enable underrepresented and lower socioeconomic communities the opportunity to acquire support for the growth and development of children and obtain assistance in the pursuit of the child's educational endeavors.    

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
* The basic need/goal involved in this activity is education and financial accessibility. Allowing access to education by gaining financial assistance for the user's families gives their children the opportunity to prepare for their future by cultivating new perspectives, exploring and building upon current knowledge for the purpose of informing others, and gaining access to a wider range of professional career and personal growth opportunities. 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
* Currently, to satisfy the financial assistance needs for early education and care programs, families are able to contact Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies (CCR&Rs) or enroll in Child Care Payment Programs, cash aid/welfare assistance programs, and other subsidized child care programs. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology**
* Present limitations regarding financial assistance for early education and care programs include the inability to access the information in an efficient manner online, and obtaining the correct individuals to inquire about financial assistance often becomes cumbersome through the need to speak with multipl individuals through a prolonged period of time. To better facilitate the journey of acquiring financial assistance of early education and care programs, users should be given a digital guide with access to direct contacts for a more streamlined process, rather than being provided external links that require users to perform additional research for contact information.  

## ✏️ Step 02: Identify Target Users
**What are the characteristics of users?** 
* **Demographics** 
    * Indivuals (parent(s), guardian, grandparent(s), etc.) who have or are taking care of children that are currently within the ages of birth to 12 years old and currently reside in the state of Massachusetts. Additionally, these users usually possess household incomes that are at or below 50% of the state median income and are low socioeconomic status households.   
* **Preferences** 
    * These users currently demonstrate financial need and/or hardship within their families, therefore needed guidance and help in obtaining financial assistance for early educatiion and care programs for their children. 
* **Expertise** 
    * Users do not need any specific level of expertise to be able to navigate through this site. 

**In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?** 
* In order for users to inquire about financial assistance for early education and care programs in Massachusetts, users must visit the [Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-early-education-and-care) (EEC) site to find information. Users would most likely visit this site from their own households. Consequently, accessibility remains a crucial component for the site in order to ensure that users can gain access to the needed information to begin the process of obtaining financial assistance for early education and care programs. Once the user finds the information on the site, users may then the call, "Mass 211" or can visit or contact their local Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) agency. The phone call may take place virtually anywhere, and their agencies may vary from city to city in the state of Massachusetts. 

**What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity?** 
* To gain access to financial assistance for these childhood education and care programs, users visit the [Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-early-education-and-care) (EEC) site and click on the "Early education and care financial assistance for families" link under the "I want to..." tab. Then, they would look through the eligibility requirements. If they meet these criteria, they can move onto the "how to apply section of the site and either call "Mass 211" or contact and/or visit their closest Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) agency. If funding is available, users will be sent a notice via mail that asks them to schedule an appointment with their local Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) agency. If funding is not available, their name will be placed on a wailist. During this time, users may be sent a confirmation and renewal letter via mail. 

## ✏️ Step 03: Pick Qualitative Research Method(s)
The qualitative research method employed for this activity was **participatory observation and interaction.** The interviewee participated in multiple activities to explore the topic of educational and financial assistance among early education and care programs along with their viewpoints and perspectives on the ease and accessibility of finding the information online and on the EEC site.

### **Insights**
 * **User believes that there are an abundant amount of links, resulting in possible confusion for older individuals (19:59)** 
   * "...overwhelmed by all these... buttons and not knowing what to click and they may also be confused by like how much scrolling they have to do."
* **Most difficult thing for user to perform when searching for information is mass amounts of scrolling (21:54)** 
   * "...when you click on this tab, my mind didn't immediately [click on tabs] when I opened [the webpage], I just started scrolling right away, so that can be a lot of scrolling to get to like what would you like to do."
* **Graphics and charts made site more accessible for user (18:12)**
   * "Also [liked] how they... did these boxes, with the links to kind of draw your attention to the most important stuff."
* **Inclusion of reviews would assist user in aquiring more information about financial assistance for early education and care programs (4:52)**
   * "I would probably look at... reviews, and how other people have had their experiences with the program."

## ✏️ Step 06: Reflection
Overall, I sincerely enjoyed the contextual inquiry process and found it extremely interesting to observe the user interact with little interaction from the interviewer. I also found the background questions, specifically regarding the familiarity and knowledge of the user's interactions with financial assistance with early education and care programs to be beneficial, as it ultimately laid the foundation for the rest of the activity. One thing that I believe could have went better was to make clearer the activity topic the user would partipate in the user activity. In the beginning, the user serached for simply "early education programs" which prompted a list of colleges that offered majors and minors related to early education programs. However, this insight may also be beneficial, as this may provide an additional point of inaccessibility in finding financial assistance for parents and guardians for their child. It was also interesting to see that many of the interviewee's ppints such as the prescence of a lot of information on the site's pages were brought up, as they supported some of my preconcieved notions regarding the functionality and accessibility of the site. 

 I found the additional questions, not only about the product, but about the user’s background and personal conceptions of the space/community I am exploring to be particularly interesting. Several of the points made by the participant aligned with ideas I had already had regarding new features for the product, so it was great to see this unbiased validation, since this participant was not at all informed about my ideas. I appreciated the participant’s openness and addition of many details into their descriptions and statements — this interview allowed me to acquire a pretty clear idea of one kind of user persona. However, I am not sure if I did every component of this user interview correctly as I did pose some guiding questions/statements to the participant without following as strict of guidelines as outlined in the example script. I think what would be helpful to me would be to be a participant in a study myself and see how other more experienced researchers conduct such interviews.
