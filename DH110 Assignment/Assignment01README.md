# Increasing Accessbility of Early, Elementary, and Secondary Education Information for Parents 

--------

## Karlina Ho || DGT HUM 110 || Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation

### Description: 
##### A leading predictor regarding academic success and achievement among students revolves around the degree to which parents are involved in their child's education. Yet, numerous digital platforms and webpages often showcase inaccessible content for marginalized groups of parents including non-English speakers, disabled persons, and individuals with age-related impairments/disabilities. With the goal of educational sites to allow educators and government officials the ability to connect with parents and relay crucial information regarding their child's education, website accessibility remains essential for educational equity. Consequently, this assignment delves deeper into the government-affiliated sites of the Early and Elementary plus Secondary education sites of Massachusetts and analyzes their accessibility and usability through a heuristic  evaluation.

|Number|Heuristic|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|1|Visibility of System Status|Design should keep users informed and knowledgeable about what is going on. This is achieved through appropriate feedback within an appropriate time frame.|
|2|Match Between System and the Real World|The design should speak the language of the user. Utilize words, concepts, and phrases that the user is acquainted with instead of internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions and make the information appear naturally and logically.|
|3|User Control and Freedom|Users often make mistakes. As a result, an "emergency exit" that is clearly marked is needed to provide them an escape route to leave the unwanted or unintentional action without having to go through a lengthened process.|
|4|Consistency and Standards|Users should not think about whether different words, actions, or situations have the same meaning. Therefore, one should follow platform and industry conventions.|
|5|Error Prevention|Good error messages are key, but the best designs can prevent problems from arising in the first place. Consequently, either eliminate error-prone conditions or examine for them and provide users with a confirmation option before they commit to and execute the action.|
|6|Recognition Rather than Recall|Reduce the memory load of the user by making actions, options, and elements detectible. The user should not need to remember information from one part of the interface to another part. Information needed to utilize the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be clearly visible or easily retrievable when required.|
|7|Flexibility and Efficiency of Use|Shortcuts — which are hidden from novice users — can accelerate the interaction for the expert user where the design can accommodate to both inexperienced and experienced users alike. Therefore, allow users to tailor and personalize frequent actions.|
|8|Aesthetic and Minimalist Design|Interfaces should not have information that is unimportant or unnecessary. Extra units of information in an interface rival with more relevant units of information, which can ultimately decrease their relative visibility.|
|9|Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors|Error messages should be expressed in plain and simple language (no error codes). They should directly reveal the problem and constructively suggest a solution.|
|10|Help and Documentation|It is best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be needed to supply documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.|
