Many older people have age-related impairments that can affect how they use the web, such as declining:

vision — including reduced contrast sensitivity, color perception, and near-focus, making it difficult to read web pages
physical ability — including reduced dexterity and fine motor control, making it difficult to use a mouse and click small targets
hearing — including difficulty hearing higher-pitched sounds and separating sounds, making it difficult to hear podcasts and other audio, especially when there is background music
cognitive ability — including reduced short-term memory, difficulty concentrating, and being easily distracted, making it difficult to follow navigation and complete online tasks
