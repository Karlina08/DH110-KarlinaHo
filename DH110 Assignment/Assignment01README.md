# Increasing Accessbility of Early, Elementary, and Secondary Education Information for Parents 

--------

## Karlina Ho || DGT HUM 110 || Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation
### Description: 
##### A leading predictor regarding academic success and achievement among students revolves around the degree to which parents are involved in their child's education. Yet, numerous digital platforms and webpages often showcase inaccessible content for marginalized groups of parents including non-English speakers, disabled persons, and individuals with age-related impairments/disabilities. With the goal of educational sites to allow educators and government officials the ability to connect with parents and relay crucial information regarding their child's education, website accessibility remains essential for educational equity. Consequently, this assignment delves deeper into the government-affiliated sites of the Early and Elementary plus Secondary education sites of Massachusetts and analyzes their accessibility and usability through a heuristic  evaluation. 

### [Jakob Nielson's 10 Usability Heurisitcs](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
|Number|Heuristic|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|1|Visibility of System Status|Design should keep users informed and knowledgeable about what is going on. This is achieved through appropriate feedback within an appropriate time frame.|
|2|Match Between System and the Real World|The design should speak the language of the user. Utilize words, concepts, and phrases that the user is acquainted with instead of internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions and make the information appear naturally and logically.|
|3|User Control and Freedom|Users often make mistakes. As a result, an "emergency exit" that is clearly marked is needed to provide them an escape route to leave the unwanted or unintentional action without having to go through a lengthened process.|
|4|Consistency and Standards|Users should not think about whether different words, actions, or situations have the same meaning. Therefore, one should follow platform and industry conventions.|
|5|Error Prevention|Good error messages are key, but the best designs can prevent problems from arising in the first place. Consequently, either eliminate error-prone conditions or examine for them and provide users with a confirmation option before they commit to and execute the action.|
|6|Recognition Rather than Recall|Reduce the memory load of the user by making actions, options, and elements detectible. The user should not need to remember information from one part of the interface to another part. Information needed to utilize the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be clearly visible or easily retrievable when required.|
|7|Flexibility and Efficiency of Use|Shortcuts — which are hidden from novice users — can accelerate the interaction for the expert user where the design can accommodate to both inexperienced and experienced users alike. Therefore, allow users to tailor and personalize frequent actions.|
|8|Aesthetic and Minimalist Design|Interfaces should not have information that is unimportant or unnecessary. Extra units of information in an interface rival with more relevant units of information, which can ultimately decrease their relative visibility.|
|9|Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors|Error messages should be expressed in plain and simple language (no error codes). They should directly reveal the problem and constructively suggest a solution.|
|10|Help and Documentation|It is best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be needed to supply documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.|

### [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
|Rating|Description|

### [Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-early-education-and-care)
### Site Overview: 
#### The Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) is part of the Executive Office of Education and the chief agency regarding the entirety of early education and care services found in the Commonwealth. As 1 of the 9 Executive Offices under the Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker, the EEC sets the politics and regulations affiliated to early education and care services and programs. Additionally, the site provides various resources, programs, certifications, and news made to assist caregivers with childhood development. 
#### In my heuristic evaluation, my perspective will focus on a parent who uses English as their second language, is visually and physically impaired, and is interested in learning more about various resources and programs for improvement upon their child's early childhood development. As a result, reading websites and decreased motor control will greatly affect their user experience throughout the site. My overall evaluation of the site before my heuristic evaluation is that the site is fairly easy to navigate, with key information presented in visualizations and easy-to-find links. Additionally, the site allows users to personalize the page by selecting a language of their choice. However, throughout many of the pages on the site, it can be argued that too many hyperlinks are utilized for users to access necessary plans, portals, and services which can impact not just the ease of access to documents for users, but also readability to parents with visual impairments as a fair amount of text is written in blue. For example, in order to learn about financial assistance for early education and care, users must click through a drop down menu, scroll down and click on another hyperlink, and then utilize a dropdown menu to directly access specfic information. Users are then provided with descriptions with additional hyperlinks, overall creating a hyperlink loop.

### Heuristic Evaluation: 
Heuristic | EEC Heuristic Evaluation | Recommendation | Severity Rating
--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------------
**Visibility of System Status** | **Issue:** When users hover over the menu bar on the words, "News," "Events," and "Locations," the links do not change color, bold, nor provide any type of system status to acknowledge to the user that the site is responding to their mouse hovering over the link unlike its dropdown counterparts. ![website of MA Department of Early Education and Care](DHVis.png) | **Recommendation:** When cursor is hovering over the link, provide users with feedback (such as a color change or bolded words) to acknowledge that the link is ready to be clicked | 3 
**Match Between System and Real World** | **Issue:**  Throughout the site, drop down menus and hyperlinks are accompanied by side arrows. Although dropdown menus utilize down areas to signify additional dropdown choices, side arrows represent to the user that they should click the link. Since down arrows represent that a dropdown menu is available, it may not be intuitve to the user that side arrows mean to click. ![website of MA Department of Early Education and Care](DHReal.png) | **Recommendation:** Consider changing the side arrows to just bold or underlined text when the user is hovering over the link. | 1  
**User control and freedom** | **Issue:** After users are able to search for a specfic term or phrase in the search bar and click on a link, if they believe it is the incorrect link, there is no back button or back arrow present on the site for ease of user control and freedom. ![website of MA Department of Early Education and Care](DHUse.png) | **Recommendation:** Insert a back arrow or back button at the top or bottom of the webpage for the user | 2 
**Consistency and standards** | **Issue:**  Throughout the entire site, underlined words are hyperlinks that led users to other webpages. Yet, "Key" in the "Key Information" section on the home page only is underlined but does not take users to another page, document, or site. ![website of MA Department of Early Education and Care](DHCon.png)| **Recommendation:** To remain consistent with the rest of the hyperlinks found throughout the site, EEC should consider boxing, changing the font, or alter the size of the font to ensure that words underlined are not mistaken for hyperlinks. | 1  
**Error prevention** | **Issue:** As the EEC is part of the Massachusetts Government website, users are able to utilize a menu button on the top left corner to navigate themselves to different sites. Unfortunately, users may believe they are still on the EEC page, and become confused with options such as "living," "working," and "visiting and exploring." ![website of MA Department of Early Education and Care](DHError.png) | **Recommendation:** Provide users with a small pop up to let them know they are about to exit the EEC site. | 2
**Recognition Rather than Recall** | The search bar on the site does not provide any potential search bar results when words are typed into it, overall lacking any kind of recognition feature. ![website of MA Department of Early Education and Care](DHRecognition.png) | **Recommendation:** Provide users with an auto-complete option based on the characters entered. | 2 
**Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:** | Although the page provides users with two search boxes that can provide them with flexibility, individuals on the site may become confused for which search bar to you, hindering efficiency. Even more, users may believe that because of the magnifying glass, clicking on the object may be the only way to search for items on the site. ![website of MA Department of Early Education and Care](DHFlex.png) | **Recommendation:** Eliminate one of the search boxes and/or include the words "press enter" after searching. | 2 
**Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:** | **Issue:** The large colored bars for each class at the home page are not needed. They clutter the page and make it so you have to scroll more. | **Recommendation:** Take away the colored blocks and just have separate, distinct boxes for each course.

**Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Have a non-concerning message about an error and give information on how to fix it of move forward. | **Bad:** Error notifications have to be manually put on, through a 4 step process. | **Recommendation:** Have error notifications be set automatically. The user can manually turn them off if that is their choice.


**Help and documentation:** Have easily accessible and understandable help pages or pages with commonly asked questions. | **Bad:** Help takes you to an outside page, out of the app. The help seems to be more catered to administrators, rather than users. No search for help. No FAQ, common issues. No Trouble shooting. Help does not reflect the app or how it looks. | **Recommendation:** Have a help that is centered for users within the app and one that reflects the app that is in use. An FAQ of troubleshooting option in the app would also be helpful.

### Site Overview: 
#### The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (ESE) is acknowledged by the United States Department of Education at the state education agency for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Ran by the Early Education Department, the main responsibility for the ESE is to promote the accessibility of early childhood resources, materials, and services accross Massachusetts for all public schools ranging from pre-k to high school. In my heuristic evaluation, my perspective will also center around a parent who uses English as a second language, is visually and physically impaired, and is interested in gaigning more information regarding resources and materials for their middle school child. 

### Heuristic Evaluation: 
Heuristic | ESE Heuristic Evaluation | Recommendation | Severity Rating
--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------------
**Visibility of System Status:** | **Issue:** When users hover over images, no words, colors, nor increased picture sizes occur, hindering a user's ability to acknowledge that the links are embedded in the actual photos. Instead, the user may believe the word "link" should be clicked on to access the information. ![website of MA Department of Early Education and Care](DHvis2.png) | **Recommendation:** When cursor is hovering over the link, provide users with feedback (such as a color change or bolded words) to acknowledge that the link is ready to be clicked | 3 




**Match between system and real world:** Design and icons are based off of general knowledge. Things the user will easily recognize. | **Bad:** The graph at the bottom is not necessarily reflective of grades, not as easily recognizable. Within calendar there is a funnel, which has an unclear meaning - it means other classes. Three dots in calendar takes you to settings and that goes to a setting of notification time. | **Recommendation:** The graph could be changed to an A+ symbol. The funnel could be a plus (indicating for more) or three dots. The notification time setting can be better, since there is only one option in settings, to have a different icon of a bell is better for notifications.


**User control and freedom:** User has options, such as undo or redo. | **Bad:** In notifications, there is a list of notifications that have been sent by instructor to the class through CCLE. I have multiple messages but there is no back button. Three dots at the top do not have a back button. | **Recommendationt:** Place a back button option at the top in addition to the three dot icon.


**Consistency and standards:** Design and usage is consistent across all pages of the web/app. | **Bad:** Some drop down menus are not the same style: check in circle; smaller, dark circle in larger one; square vs circle. In each course there are options at the top for Contents, Grades, and Competencies. Competencies is empty and the meaning of it is unknown. | **Recommendation:** Have a uniform drop down menu style and select option. Have a description on pages where there is no information or titles can be ambiguous. 


**Error prevention:** Provide safety nets for user, such as confirming an action. | **Good:** There is a save button for when submitting assignments. | **No Recommendation:** There seem to be enough precautions in place that will prevent the user from making any detrimental actions that cannot be undone.
**Recognition Rather than Recall | The search bar fails to provide any potential search bar results when words are typed into it. Therefore, information is retrieved less easily as the user must recall rather than recognize. ![website of MA Department of Early Education and Care](DHRec2.png) | **Recommendation:** Allow users to use an query auto-complete option to predict the user's searches based on the characters entered. | 2 


**Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Make a page that is accessible to all, have basic functions at the forefront and more advanced options accessible through more steps. |**Good:** General settings and then more advanced, less used ones separate, such as synching. **Bad:** Sometimes there is extra navigation involved that does not require it, there is only one option in each navigation step. | **Recommendation:** Depending on how many options in each setting step, reduce the amount of steps to get to the end option.


**Aesthetic and minimalist design:** | **Issue:** Massive amounts of white text on the dark navy background can be overwhelming for the user to read and/or negatively affect individuals with a visual impairment. Even more, certain links such as "About the Commissioner" and "Commissioner's Updates" under "Commissioner's Office" could be consolidated onto one webpage. ![website of MA Department of Elementary and Secondary Education](DHAes2.png) | **Recommendation** Consolidate certain tabs or insert a few dropdown menus to shorten the length of the page.


**Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Have a non-concerning message about an error and give information on how to fix it of move forward. | **Bad:** Error notifications have to be manually put on, through a 4 step process. | **Recommendation** Have error notifications be set automatically. The user can manually turn them off if that is their choice.


**Help and documentation:** Have easily accessible and understandable help pages or pages with commonly asked questions. | **Bad:** Help takes you to an outside page, out of the app. The help seems to be more catered to administrators, rather than users. No search for help. No FAQ, common issues. No Trouble shooting. Help does not reflect the app or how it looks. | **Recommendation:** Have a help that is centered for users within the app and one that reflects the app that is in use. An FAQ of troubleshooting option in the app would also be helpful.
